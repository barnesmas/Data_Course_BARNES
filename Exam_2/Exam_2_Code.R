# 10. BONUS - Using your preferred model, predict what the U5MR would be for Ecuador in the year 2020. The real value for Ecuador for 2020 was 13 under-5 deaths per 1000 live births. How far off was your model prediction???

## None of these models are good. They are linear models, and the data for ecuador looks to be decreasing in a non linear fashion. Which means all the models will be wrong near the ends. The model that looks least wrong for Ecuador in years approaching 2020 is mod 1, giving a predicted rate of 11.44224. This is off by 1.55776.


# Even though mod3 has a lower RMSE over all, the prediction for Ecuador in 2020 is -10.58018 which doesn't even make sense. and is off by 22.
