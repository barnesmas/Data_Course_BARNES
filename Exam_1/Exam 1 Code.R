# Task 1


# Read the cleaned_covid_data.csv file into an R data frame. (20 pts)*


  # getting working directory

 # Subset the data set to just show states that begin with "A" and save this as an object called A_states. (20 pts)

  covid$Province_State %>% 
  startsWith(., 'A') %>% 
  covid[.,]

# Task III.
# **Create a plot _of that subset_ showing Deaths over time, with a separate facet for each state. (20 pts)**
#   
#   + Create a scatterplot
# + Add loess curves WITHOUT standard error shading
# + Keep scales "free" in each facet

# Task IV 
# **Find the "peak" of Case_Fatality_Ratio for each state and save this as a new data frame object called state_max_fatality_rate. (20 pts)**
#   
#   I'm looking for a new data frame with 2 columns:
# 
#  + "Province_State"
#  + "Maximum_Fatality_Ratio"
#  + Arrange the new data frame in descending order by Maximum_Fatality_Ratio
#  
# This might take a few steps. Be careful about how you deal with missing values!

# Task V
#   **Use that new data frame from task IV to create another plot. (20 pts)**
#   
#   + X-axis is Province_State
# + Y-axis is Maximum_Fatality_Ratio
# + bar plot
# + x-axis arranged in descending order, just like the data frame (make it a factor to accomplish this)
# + X-axis labels turned to 90 deg to be readable
# 
# Even with this partial data set (not current), you should be able to see that (within these dates), different states had very different fatality ratios.


    #I will use a different command to arrange x-axis in descending order, having already converted to a factor previously.

# Task VI.** (BONUS 10 pts)
# **Using the FULL data set, plot cumulative deaths for the entire US over time
#   
#   + You'll need to read ahead a bit and use the dplyr package functions group_by() and summarize() to accomplish this.
